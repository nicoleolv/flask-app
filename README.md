# International Space Shuttle Trajectory Data Flask Web Application 

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to full flask application web and prints out a few informative statistics, including all the epochs, part of the epochs specified by the user, state vectors from one specific epoch, the instantaneous speed and state vectors nearest in time, and the full epoch closest to when the program was executed. This data is useful and important to gather accurate information about space and ensure the ISS is safe and not colliding with other objects in space. Overall, this project is used to gain familiarity with flask web applications and routes, while also analyzing important ISS data.
